              <h3>Alfie</h3>
              <p>The websites for Alfie is the first website Team Alliance has done for a client. It's not the most complicated website, but it was fun and it was a fast website to design and develop.</p>
              <p>He uses the website on his domain (www.alfie.digital) and is showing his work and service. He is a photographer and graphic designer.</p>

              <h3>Zilox</h3>
              <p>Zilox is a high quality practice server with many custom features. It was tough to develop the player count because it needed to track players from two of their servers (eu.zilox.org and us.zilox.org).</p>
              <p>The four icon links are custom vector icons made by us in Illustrator. It was a fun website to make and we learned a lot from it.</p>

              <h3>Bluee's Builds</h3>
              <p>Bluee's Builds is a Minecraft building service. We made him a nice logo with his requests. He requested it to be modern, blue color and to have fire in it.</p>
              <p>He is a Mineplex builder and his IGN is BlueeFiree. It turned out to be a cool logo and we are happy with it.</p>

              <h3>Prime Blocks</h3>
              <p>Prime Blocks is an awesome Minecraft build team. We made the logo for them in exchange for a vouch. This is our favourite and maybe the best logo untill now that we made.</p>
              <p>The logo is completely custom made and we didn't use any fonts for it. All the letters are made by us.</p>

              <p>Dive is just a logo that we made for showing off our range in logo design. We wanted to show that we can work with organic not just geometrical shapes.</p>
              <p>The logo turned out super well and we learned a lot from doing it.</p>

              <p>The logo for Java Plugins is one of the first logos we've done. We contacted Java_Coder regarding a free vector logo and he accepted.</p>
              <p>First he did not have an idea on how the logo should look like, after some questions and examples we got his vision and his taste and we made him his logo.</p>
